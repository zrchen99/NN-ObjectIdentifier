# NN-ObjectIdentifier
you would have to change the path to the sdd and dbi datasets to be trained on.
For the test differentiating between SDD and DBI datasets,
create a new folder named sdd_dbi and group the sdd images in 1 folder and the dbi images in the other.
To run the models, use NN-Image Classifier.ipynb in jupyter.
